# Ngombe

This is a local-first app that I built because the app I usually used to track my drink intake had bugs and restricted all features, including basic ones, behind a paywall.

### How to Run

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### How to Test

```sh
pnpm test # or pnpm test:ui
```

#### Ngombe?

Ngombe (pronounced `/ˈŋɒmbɛ/`) is a javanese word for drink.
